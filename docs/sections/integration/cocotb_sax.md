# CocoTB - SAX Integration

This integration aims to provide an co-design mechanism for solving photonic circuit networking. One common application might be to see how a set of configured phase-shifter switches, might affect the total output of a system, and how this corresponds to the electronic function that is applied in order to drive it.
