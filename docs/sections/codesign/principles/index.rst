Fundamental Principles Theory
=============================

It is important to understand the fundamental physical relationships of consigning photonics and electronics systems. Really, we are combining two engineering fields: photonics engineering and electronics engineering. The overlap between the fields, and interconnected relationships, are essential to optimise the system design between them.
