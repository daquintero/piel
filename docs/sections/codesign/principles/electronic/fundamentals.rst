Fundamental Electronic Definitions

There are some important definitions we must account for in terms of analysing the data of our simulations.

   * - Term
     - Definition
     - Unit
   * - Voltage :math:`V`
     - The work on electric charges.
     - It takes :math:`1J` Joule to move :math:`1C` Coulomb of charge through a potential of :math:`1V` volt.
   * - Current :math:`i`
     - The rate of the flow of electric charge past a point.
     - :math:`1A` amp defines the movement of the above :math:`1C` Coulomb of charge flows in :math:`1s` second.
   * - Power :math:`W`
     - For a differential of time, this is the rate energy consumed for that slice of time.
     - :math:`W = VI` Watt defines the rate of energy flow of the above :math:`1J` Joule in :math:`1s` second.
   * - Energy :math:`J`
     - Applied power throughout a slice of time.
     - :math:`J = Ws` Joule is equal to :math:`1W` Watt of power flowing throughout :math:`1s` second.


Currents occur by placing a voltage through a device, and the rate of the current, hence the rate of the power consumption is dependent on the channel *impedance*.
Now, this has an important effect on microwave engineering and system design.
Let's consider some unit conversion, since it is important particularly between relating time and frequency, and DC and RF metrics.
