.. py:function:: unitary_permanent(unitary_matrix: numpy.ndarray) -> tuple

   The permanent of a unitary is used to determine the state probability of combinatorial Gaussian boson samping systems.

   ``thewalrus`` Ryser's algorithm permananet implementation is described here: https://the-walrus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gallery/permanent_tutorial.html

   # TODO maybe implement subroutine if computation is taking forever.
   # TODO why two outputs? Understand this properly later.

   :param unitary_permanent: The unitary matrix.
   :type unitary_permanent: np.ndarray

   :returns: The circuit permanent and the time it took to compute it.
   :rtype: tuple


.. py:function:: sax_circuit_permanent(sax_input: sax.SType) -> tuple

   The permanent of a unitary is used to determine the state probability of combinatorial Gaussian boson samping systems.

   ``thewalrus`` Ryser's algorithm permananet implementation is described here: https://the-walrus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gallery/permanent_tutorial.html

   # TODO maybe implement subroutine if computation is taking forever.

   :param sax_input: The sax S-parameter dictionary.
   :type sax_input: sax.SType

   :returns: The circuit permanent and the time it took to compute it.
   :rtype: tuple
