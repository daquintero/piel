    A frequency-domain representation of transmission requires the full input response which can be represented

class NetworkTransmission(Instance):

    This corresponds to a transmission component or array collection of the power or frequency transmission.
    For example, for the reflected power (ie S11 transmission), this contains magnitude and phase information from a source.
    Instead of responding to a given input. Note that this does not contain mode information, but could
    be extended to implement this.

    This can represent frequency to single-state conversion and a sckit-rf collective model too, based on its definition.

    This implementation is flexible because making the transmission individual is kind of essential when dealing with both electronic-photonic s-parameter state
    management, or otherwise it involves writing a mapping function. This is not the fastest approach, but certainly complete.
    Maybe someone can come up with a more complete approach that is not so resource intensive or we can abstract this into
    defined base-types (but I think this is it though if any validation is to be applied?)

    This can also be equivalent to a sckit-rf Network static data container, just that it decomposes each specific transmission to a given
    frequency or power-point. It implements translation between RF models and Photonic models which are more-port specific
    as defined by SAX. This enables more specific electronic-photonic state mapping.
